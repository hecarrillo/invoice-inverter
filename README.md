# invoice-inverter
c++ code to invert a list of strings from a specified .txt and writes them into a new specified .txt file

To run this code, first download a c++ compiler (g++ is prefered). Then, download this repo into a known directory and run the following:

```sh
g++ inversor.cpp -std=c++11 
```
This will compile the c++ code. In case you cannot compile it, simply run the a.out provided in the repo by typing: 

```sh
./a.out 
```

And that will prompt the following:

NOTE: You have to have a .txt file with a list of string for inversion in the same folder (file provided in the repo, just input "folios_entrada" when asked the name of the input file name). This will generate another .txt file with the name you provide with the list of inverted strings.
